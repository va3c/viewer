### Any Three.js file can be a template 
Ordinary Three.js files that may be on your hard disk or network may often be used as templates. Why not try a few? A WIP - many fixes on way.

<input type=file id=inpTemplate onchange=VH.getFile(this); />

### Screen Grabber Template
Issue: When you blog or tweet frequently then it's great to have access to lots of images of the apps you are working with.

Screen capture is the usual way of creating the images, but it often takes a lot of snipping and cropping to get things just right

Solution: The Hacker Screen Grabber template allows you to open and load files, tweak them so they are just right, create an image and save it as a PNG file.
